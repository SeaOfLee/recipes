### Ingredients

| Qty  | Notes |
|---|---|
| 3 cups AP or Bread flour | White or whole wheat works well  |
| 1/4 teaspoon yeast | Active Dry or Instant  |
| 1 teaspoon salt |   |
| 1 1/2 cups hot water| Can use hot tap water - 125-130F. Should be warm to touch.  |
| Parchment Paper | For easy cleanup & even cooking |

### Directions

1. Combine flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Stir in water until it’s well combined.
2. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 3 hours.
3. After 3 hours dough will become puffy and dotted with bubbles. Transfer it to a well-floured surface and sprinkle dough with a little flour. Using a scraper (or just your hands) fold dough over 10-12 times & shape into a rough ball.
4. Place in a parchment paper-lined bowl and cover with a towel. Let stand on counter top for about 35 minutes.
5. In the meantime place Dutch oven with lid in a cold oven and preheat to 450° F. My oven takes 35 minutes to reach 450°.
6. When oven reaches 450° carefully, using oven gloves, lift the parchment paper and dough from the bowl and place gently into the hot pot. (parchment paper goes in the pot too) Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
7. After 30 minutes, remove lid and parchment paper. Return, uncovered, to oven and bake 10 - 15 more minutes.  

##### Notes  
Once cooled, bread can be sliced and/or frozen.
