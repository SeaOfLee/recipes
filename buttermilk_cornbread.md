### Ingredients

| Qty  | Notes|
|---|---|
| 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter | melted  |
| 1/4 cup sugar |  |
| 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup |  |
| 2 eggs | room temperature  |
| 1 cup buttermilk | room temperature  |
| 1 cup AP flour |  |
| 1 cup AP cornmeal |  |
| 1/2 tsp kosher salt |  |
| 1/2 tsp baking soda |  |
| 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter | melted (optional - for brushing) |



### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375. Coat an 8x8 baking dish with nonstick spray or butter.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine melted butter, sugar and honey/syrup. Whisk in eggs one at a time, beating until smooth. Add buttermilk and whisk to combine.
3. In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the flout, cornmeal, salt and baking soda. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring with a spatula until mostly smooth.
4. Pour the mixture into the greased baking dish, smooth top with spatula. Let sit for 3 minutes, then place in oven.
5. Bake for 25-35 minutes (35 in my oven), until top is golden brown and a chopstick poked into the middle comes out clean.
6. Remove from oven, let cool for 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving. Serve with salted butter.
